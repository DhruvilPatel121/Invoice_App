Ideation Workflow
Three Phases
The unified skill routes to one of three phases based on where the user is in their ideation journey.

Decision Tree
Start Here: Which phase do I use?
Q: What's the state of the user's request?

If the request... Use Phase... Read
Is missing: who, why, success criteria, or constraint Interview references/interview.md
Is vague but user wants to explore options Refine references/refine.md
Is already a clear concept needing design Design references/design.md
Phase 1: Interview - When to use
Trigger conditions:

The ask is missing: who, why, success criteria, or constraint
User says: "interview me", "grill me", "are we sure?"
You're tempted to assume requirements you haven't surfaced
Request is conventional ("build me X") without specifics
Stop condition:

You can predict the user's reaction to the next 3 questions (95% confidence)
Output: Confirmed statement of intent

Phase 2: Refine - When to use
Trigger conditions:

User has clear intent but idea is vague
User says: "ideate", "refine this idea", "stress-test my plan"
Need to expand options before converging
Stop condition:

User confirms a direction and "Not Doing" list
Output: Refined concept one-pager

Phase 3: Design - When to use
Trigger conditions:

User has a refined concept
Any creative work begins
User says: "brainstorm", "design", "let's figure out how to build"
Stop condition:

User approves the design spec
Output: Design specification document

Phase Connections
Phase 1 → Phase 2
When Phase 1 output (confirmed intent) is too vague, hand off to Phase 2:

"I've clarified what you want: [restate]. Now let's refine this into a sharper concept."
Phase 2 → Phase 3
When Phase 2 output (refined concept) is ready, hand off to Phase 3:

"We have a strong concept: [direction]. Now let's design the spec."
Phase 3 → Implementation
After Phase 3 output (design spec) is approved:

"Design approved. Let me create the implementation plan."
Key Points
Mutually exclusive triggers - Each phase has clear trigger conditions that don't overlap
Sequential flow - Phase 1 → Phase 2 → Phase 3, but can skip phases if user is already further along
User approval gate - Each phase ends with explicit user confirmation before moving on
No code before design - Never write implementation code before Phase 3 design is approved
